 * The TSL2550 is a light sensor communicating with the MSP430
 * via I2C on the USART0 port.
 *
 * Once powered-up, the chip continuously samples
 * the ambient light with two photodiodes, that need
 * to be further processed in order to get a light power
 * value in lux. See the datasheet for more details.

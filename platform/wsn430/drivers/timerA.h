/**
 * \defgroup timerA Timer A driver
 * \ingroup wsn430
 * @{
 * The timerA driver offers some abstraction for the corresponding MSP430 block.
 * This driver allows the generation of alarms. Once a timer is configured
 * for a given clock tick, it is possible to set several alarms
 * that will call some registered callback functions
 * once they have expired.
 *
 * An alarm is mainly defined by a time reference and a duration.
 * The alarm expires (or fires) when the timer counter reaches
 * the time reference plus the duration. It is also possible
 * to declare periodic alarms that will call the callback
 * function once every duration.
 *
 * The timerA is sourced from ACLK (limitation due to driver design),
 * and can register 3 simultaneous timer alarms plus an overflow alarm.
 *

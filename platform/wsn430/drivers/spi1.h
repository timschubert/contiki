 * @{
 *
 * The SPI1 driver allows SPI communication
 * using the USART1 block of the MSP430. This driver is mainly
 * used by other peripheral devices' drivers.
 *
 * It defines macros to initialize the SPI module,
 * to chip select/deselect the three default hardware
 * peripherals connected by SPI to the MSP430,
 * to write/read bytes to/from these peripherals.
 *
 * Note that when chip selecting a device,
 * the driver automatically deselects
 * the two other ones to avoid bus collision.

This archive contains the drivers for the WSN430 main board, along with their descriptions. Drivers for both WSN430 platforms is provided.
	Last up to date version can be found on: http://www.senslab.info/

There are two versions of the WSN430 board. The names have absolutely no links with the drivers versions, which represent new features and bug fixes:
	* one with a CC1101 radio chip, known as wsn430v13b (especially in the platform simulator WSIM)
        * the other with a CC2420 radio chip, known as wsn430v14 (especially in the platform simulator WSIM)

The documentation for these drivers may be found on the dedicated Doxygen documentation page:

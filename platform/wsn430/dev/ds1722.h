/**
 * \defgroup ds1722 DS1722 temperature sensor driver
 * \ingroup wsn430
 * @{
 * The DS1722 chip is a digital thermometer from MAXIM.
 * It communicates with the MSP430 via an SPI bus.
 *
 * This temperature sensor has two main modes of sampling:
 * one-shot and continuous; and a temperature resolution
 * between 8 and 12 bits.
 *
 * There are two 8bit registers in the chip (the LSB and MSB)
 * containing the latest sampled value that can be read from SPI.
 * When asked for continuous sampling,
 * the chip samples and updates the two register repeatedly,
 * whereas for a one-shot conversion it is done only once.
